# Setup

A running instance of vault is required. To have one you can either setup vault [locally](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/vault/getting-started) or use hashicorp's [cloud](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/) option.

Make sure to export vault address and token in `VAULT_ADDR` and `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable locally.
